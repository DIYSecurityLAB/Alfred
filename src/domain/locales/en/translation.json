    "reflectionTitle": "Reflection: Bitcoin as a Libertarian Tool",
    "reflection1": "If Bitcoin is truly a libertarian tool, why do governments still allow individuals to legally buy BTC?",
    "reflection2": "The answer lies in how conventional Bitcoin purchases work: to acquire BTC through traditional exchanges, you need to provide all your personal data, the famous KYC (Know Your Customer). This means the government has access to all the information about your transaction, including where your Bitcoin is and who owns it.",
    "reflection3": "While you pay a small fee per transaction, the real cost comes at the time of withdrawal. In addition to the fixed withdrawal fee, your transactions are exposed to government control. And the price of this exposure can be high: taxes of up to 27.5% may apply, depending on your location and current regulations.",
    "reflection4": "The 'convenience' of conventional exchanges can end up being much more expensive than you think. Moreover, by handing over your personal data, you never know how it might be used or manipulated in the future.",
