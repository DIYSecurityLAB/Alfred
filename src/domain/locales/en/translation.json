    "transactionLimitsPolicyTitle": "Transaction Limits and Limit Increase Policy",
    "transactionLimitsPolicyDescription": "The AlfredP2P platform operates with a progressive transaction limit system, aiming to ensure a secure, gradual experience that complies with market best practices and guidelines for preventing illicit activities.\n\nCurrently, the standard limits for users operating directly through the platform are as follows:\n\nTransaction limit: R$5,000 (five thousand Brazilian reais)\n\nDaily limit: R$6,000 (six thousand Brazilian reais)\n\nThese values were defined considering the balance between agility and security, especially for new users who are starting their Bitcoin buying and selling operations through our environment.\n\nAs the user progresses in their relationship with Alfred—demonstrating regularity, reliability, and a history of successful transactions—it is possible to increase these limits in a personalized way, according to internal risk analysis criteria and profile verification.\n\nHowever, it is important to highlight that the limit increase process follows a specific flow, different from the platform's automated flow. For this reason, to request an expansion of the allowed values per transaction or per day, the user must contact Alfred's support team. Our team is prepared to guide you on the evaluation criteria, necessary documentation, and other steps that make up this process.\n\nWe reinforce our commitment to transparency, security, and close service to each user. The customization of limits is an important tool that allows us to serve users with different profiles and needs, without compromising the integrity of the platform or the principles that govern responsible action in the crypto asset market.\n\nIf you are interested in expanding your operational limits, please contact our support through the official channels informed on our platform. It will be a pleasure to accompany you on your journey with Alfred.",
