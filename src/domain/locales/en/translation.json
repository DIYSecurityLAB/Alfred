      "We are a family deconstructing a P2P ecosystem, without KYC, to be used by anyone, anywhere.",
      "According to praxeology, the logic of human action always seeks to change from a less satisfactory state to a more satisfactory one. Diy Sec Lab enables a free market of P2P sellers and buyers in the simplest and friendliest way.",
      "Unlike a conventional cryptocurrency exchange, we connect buyers and sellers in a P2P format, safely and privately. All Bitcoins traded on Diy Sec Lab are whitelisted, meaning they did not come from illicit activities and are fully legal.",
      "You may still think: “So, to buy Bitcoin without KYC and safely, do I have to trust Diy Sec Lab's P2P?”",
      "All Diy Sec Lab attendants are pre-selected in the SpikeProvider model, leaving a value in BTC locked on the platform as a guarantee to work with us. Thus, if any Diy Sec Lab attendant cheated, they would automatically be financially penalized in amounts far exceeding the trades.",
      "Finally, in case of any problem, the client can contact the SpikeHelper by providing the trade ID. The problem will be carefully analyzed until resolved. We are committed to creating the best experience for you."

    "reflection2": "Basically because those who still buy bitcoin 'conventionally' need to provide all their personal details to the exchange, doing the famous KYC. This way, the government will know every satoshi you bought and where to find it.",
    "reflection3": "It is true that when you buy bitcoin this way, you pay a small fee for each trade, but at the time of withdrawal, in addition to paying another fixed fee, your transaction will be exposed to Leviathan, and the tax will be inevitable, potentially reaching 22.5%.",
