      "We are a family deconstructing a P2P ecosystem, without KYC, to be used by anyone, anywhere.",
      "According to praxeology, the logic of human action always seeks a change from a less satisfactory state to a more satisfactory one. Diy Sec Lab enables the free market of P2P buyers and sellers in the simplest and most user-friendly way.",
      "Unlike a conventional cryptocurrency exchange, we connect buyers and sellers in a P2P format, securely and privately. All Bitcoins traded on Diy Sec Lab are whitelisted, meaning they do not come from illicit activities and are fully legal.",
      "You might still wonder: 'So, to buy Bitcoin without KYC and securely, will I have to trust Diy Sec Lab's P2P?'",
      "All Diy Sec Lab attendants are pre-selected under the SpikeProvider model, leaving a locked BTC amount on the platform as collateral to work with us. Thus, if any Diy Sec Lab attendant cheats, they are automatically penalized financially with amounts far greater than the trades.",
      "Finally, in case of any problem, the client can contact SpikeHelper by providing the trade ID. The issue will be carefully analyzed until its resolution. We are committed to creating the best experience for you."

    "reflection2": "Basically because those who still buy bitcoin 'conventionally' need to provide all their personal details to the exchange, doing the famous KYC. This way, the government will know every satoshi you bought and where to find it.",
    "reflection3": "It is true that when you buy bitcoin this way, you pay a small fee for each trade, but at the time of withdrawal, in addition to paying another fixed fee, your transaction will be exposed to Leviathan, and the tax will be inevitable, potentially reaching 22.5%.",
